# MRI Image Reconstruction

## Introduction
When we take MRI images, it is usually a 3-D image which could be disorienting. One way to simplify the data is to re-present the data into three orthogonal planes (i.e. transverse, saggital and coronal). Furthermore, to increase radiologists' diagnostic speed, we can use algorithm to discover abnormalities within the images. One way is to plot frequency distribution of the image.

## Goal of this Project
This code has two functions, 1) reads in the MRI data and plots the different planes. 2) plot the frequency distribution of a specific image. 

## Disclaimer
This is a scientific computing project I did during my study in University of Washington. If you are doing similar work, please **do not** simply copy the code. Try to do it yourself! The reason I am posting this codee is to showcase the work I have done so far.
